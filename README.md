# A Deadtalk Plugin for CSGO
### Status: Working
![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bazooka-codes/csgo-deadtalk-plugin/total)

Deadtalk is a function in which dead players can talk to all other dead players in server including the other team's dead players, while the living players cannot hear them. The only custom dependency is interrogate.inc, from my other plugin, so that interrogations do not break deadtalk. 

## WiT Gaming Version
This version incorporates specifically requested features and options to correspond to WiT Gaming CS:GO community servers.
This means that some functionality may be unwanted for general use, so use the general-use version.
If you would like to incorporate your own branding, options, and features: get in contact with me through pull request or
email: bazookaforreal@gmail.com.

## Compilation
Compiles normally using the Sourcemod compiler, within the scripting directory, but must include Multicolors and interrogate.inc
within the includes directory.
  Both download and online compiler can be found here: https://www.sourcemod.net/compiler.php
  Multicolors can be found here: https://github.com/Bara/Multi-Colors or included
