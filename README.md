[![Github All Releases] (https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bazooka-codes/csgo-deadtalk-plugin/total)] ()

This plugin enables the Deadtalk function. This means when a player dies, they can hear and talk to all other dead players,
while also hearing their live teammates. However, living players do not hear their dead teammates. This plugin now uses Multicolors
to modify in-game chat colors.

## WiT Gaming Version
This version incorporates specifically requested features and options to correspond to WiT Gaming CS:GO community servers.
This means that some functionality may be unwanted for general use, so use the general-use version.
If you would like to incorporate your own branding, options, and features: get in contact with me through pull request or
email: bazookaforreal@gmail.com.


Compilation: Compiles normally using the Sourcemod compiler, within the scripting directory, but must include Multicolors
within the includes directory.
  Both download and online compiler can be found here: https://www.sourcemod.net/compiler.php
  Multicolors can be found here: https://github.com/Bara/Multi-Colors or included
